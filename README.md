# S3ZipFileLoader

A Java AWS Lambda function used as Cloud Formation Custom Resource to extract one or more ZIP files from a source S3 bucket to a target bucket.

When deploying an AWS stack with CloudFormation, it can be helpful to populate a new bucket with the contents of a ZIP file.

Cloudformation example coming soon ...
